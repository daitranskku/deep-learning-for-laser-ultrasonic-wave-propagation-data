## ULTRASONIC WAVE PROPAGATION IMAGING (UWPI) FROM DEEP LEARNING PERSPECTIVE (Updated Nov 4 2020)
This repo contains all source code from UWPI processing to signal processing and deep learning applications.

[UWPI processing](uwpi_processing.ipynb) script shows how to stack signals in to 3D frame for visualization.

We can use B-SCOPE image to identify time when ultrasonic waves reach the edge or the bolted joint
